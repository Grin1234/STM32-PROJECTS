## üü° Button-Led (With / Without Interrupt)

### üìà Graph - No Interrupt  
![Graph-NoInterrupt](ASSETS/Graph_Button_NOINT.jpeg)  
Had to put some delay for debouncing, it crashes my SWV without...

### üìà Graph - With Interrupt  
![Graph-Interrupt](ASSETS/Graph_Button_INT.jpeg)  
Led/Button graphs overlap, no problem with SWV even w/o delays ;]

## üî¢ 7 Segment MUX CTRL

7 Segment Display using GPIO + Timer + Interrupts

### üß∞ Schematic  
![7-Schematic](ASSETS/pmodssd1.png)  
Common cathode configuration  

- Use Vcc = 3V if possible  
- P4(C) signal chooses between the 7SEG displays

Because only one digit can be lit at a particular time, we need to alternately light up the two digits at least every 20 milliseconds (50 Hz).

###### (For more information and how to implement the 20 ms interrupt check out the code :)

## üìè ULTRASONIC DISTANCE SENSOR

**Model**: HC-SR04  
Distance Sensor using GPIO + Input Compare Timer + Interrupts

### How does it work?

You have 4 pins:

- **Vcc** ‚Äì 5V (HC-SR04 uses 5V)  
- **Trig** ‚Äì Output  
- **Echo** ‚Äì Input  
- **Ground** ‚Äì GND

Basically, when the **Trig (Trigger)** pin is set HIGH, it sends out 8 ultrasound pulses at 40 kHz.

> (Documentation said that 10 ¬µs is enough to keep Trig HIGH for it to be registered and to send the waves)

Then, the **Echo** pin listens for the reflected sound waves. If the waves bounce off something and return, the Echo pin goes HIGH for a period that represents the time it took to return.

Knowing that time, and the speed of sound through air, we can calculate the distance:

> Distance = (**Speed of Sound**[air] * **time**) / 2

This project uses **input capture interrupts** on both the rising and falling edges of the Echo signal to measure this time accurately.

### üîç Examples:

- `state` = TRIG  
- `echo_state` = ECHO  

#### Short distance  
![LOWGRAPH](ASSETS/DISTANCE_SENSOR_GRAPH_SHORT.jpeg)

#### Long distance  
![HIGHGRAPH](ASSETS/DISTANCE_SENSOR_GRAPH_LONG.jpeg)

As you can see, the TRIG (orange signal) is sent and kept HIGH for 10 ¬µs. If the distance is short, the ECHO (red signal) pulse is short ‚Äî and vice versa.
